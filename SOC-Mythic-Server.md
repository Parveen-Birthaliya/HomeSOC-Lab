## Overview

The `SOC-Mythic-Server` is a key component of the HomeSOC lab that simulates adversarial behavior through command-and-control (C2) activities. It serves as an emulation tool for detecting and analyzing threat actor tactics using Mythic, which aids in offensive security testing, behavior simulation, and live-response activities.

## Installation & Configuration Steps

### 1. Install Mythic C2

To deploy Mythic C2, you need Docker installed to run the containers.

* Clone Mythic repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/its-a-feature/Mythic.git
cd Mythic
```

* Set up Mythic environment:

```bash
./setup.sh
```

* Start Mythic C2 services:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

* Access the Mythic C2 UI via `http://<your-server-ip>:7443`.

### 2. Install Elastic Agent

1. Download the Elastic Agent package from the Fleet server:

```bash
wget https://artifacts.elastic.co/downloads/beats/elastic-agent/elastic-agent-<version>-linux-x86_64.tar.gz
tar -xvzf elastic-agent-<version>-linux-x86_64.tar.gz
cd elastic-agent-<version>
```

2. Install the agent with Fleet server URL and enrollment token:

```bash
sudo ./elastic-agent install --url=http://<fleet-server-ip>:8220 --enrollment-token=<your-token>
```

### 3. Configure Sysmon for Logging

Sysmon will collect additional endpoint telemetry.

* Download and install Sysmon:

```bash
curl -L https://download.sysinternals.com/files/Sysmon.zip -o Sysmon.zip
unzip Sysmon.zip
sysmon -accepteula -c sysmonconfig.xml
```

* Confirm Sysmon installation by checking logs in `C:\Windows\System32\Sysmon` for generated event logs.
