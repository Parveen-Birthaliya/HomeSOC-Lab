# HomeSOC-Lab 

## Objective
Establish a comprehensive, on-premise SOC lab to simulate real-world adversary tactics and develop end-to-end detection, investigation, and response capabilities. This environment replicates enterprise telemetry pipelines and validation playbooks‚Äîempowering you to benchmark and refine SOC processes against validated MyDFIR Challenge workflows.

## Skills Learned
* End-to-end SOC deployment and configuration on Ubuntu Server.

* Ingestion, parsing, and normalization of diverse telemetry sources in the ELK stack.

* Creation and tuning of real-time detection rules and dashboards in Kibana.

* Ticketing system integration (osTicket) for structured incident case management.

* Live-response data collection via Sysmon and Mythic C2 agent.

* Investigation techniques for brute-force, C2, and lateral-movement scenarios.

## Tools Used
* Ubuntu Server 24.02 ‚Äì Base OS for all virtualized lab components.

* ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) ‚Äì Centralized logging, search, and dashboarding.

* Elastic Agent & Fleet ‚Äì Agent deployment for unified data collection.

* Sysmon ‚Äì Detailed Windows endpoint telemetry.

* Mythic C2 ‚Äì Adversary emulation and live-response tool.

* osTicket ‚Äì Incident ticketing and workflow management.

* Suricata & Zeek ‚Äì Network traffic inspection and IDS signature tuning.
