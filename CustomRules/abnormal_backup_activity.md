# Abnormal Patterns in Backup Activity

**Detects** unusual or excessive backup operationsâ€”such as a high volume of backup jobs, backups initiated outside of scheduled windows, or backups of sensitive data by non-approved accounts. These anomalies can indicate data staging for exfiltration, unauthorized persistence, or abuse of backup credentials.

## Remediation
#### Triage

- Identify the backup jobs (`event.action`, `backup.job.id`) and target resources (`resource.name`, `cloud.account.id`).
- Determine initiating identity (`user.name`, `source.ip`) and job timing relative to approved schedule.
- Cross-reference with change-management or ticketing systems to verify authorization.

#### Containment

- Pause or cancel suspicious backup jobs via cloud console or API.
- Revoke or rotate credentials used by the initiating principal.
- Restrict backup service endpoints to approved IP ranges or VPCs.

#### Remediation

- Enforce RBAC policies limiting who can initiate backups and configure schedule windows.
- Implement approval workflows or just-in-time access for backup operations.
- Monitor backup vault usage metrics and integrate alerts with SOAR for automated remediation.

#### Post-Incident Review

- Audit all backup activity over the past 30 days to refine baselines and thresholds.
- Update SOC playbooks with identified tactics and adjust detection logic.
- Conduct a tabletop exercise simulating backup abuse scenarios to validate controls.
