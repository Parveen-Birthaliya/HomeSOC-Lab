# Abnormal Account Lockout Frequency

**Detects** when a Windows user account is locked out **three or more times** within **five minutes**, indicating a possible brute-force or password-spraying attack. Excessive lockouts often precede credential-based intrusions and, if undetected, can lead to unauthorized access, lateral movement, and compliance breaches .

## Remediation
#### Triage

Extract source IP and host name from the alert metadata (source.ip, host.name) and correlate with preceding Event ID 4625 failures to confirm brute-force behavior

.

#### Containment

- Unlock the affected account via PowerShell:

powershell
```bash
Unlock-ADAccount -Identity testuser
```
- Block the malicious IP at your perimeter firewall or Windows Defender Firewall.

#### Remediation

- Review and strengthen your AD lockout policy (e.g., set Account lockout threshold to at least 10 attempts, Reset account lockout counter after 15 minutes) per Microsoft baseline recommendations

- Enforce multifactor authentication (MFA) for all privileged and remote accounts to mitigate password-based attacks

#### Post-Incident Review

- Update rule exclusions and thresholds based on incident findings.

- Document root cause and adjust your SOC playbook accordingly.
