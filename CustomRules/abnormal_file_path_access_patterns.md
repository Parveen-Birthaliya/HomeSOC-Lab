# Abnormal File Path Access Patterns

**Detects** unusual access to sensitive, hidden, or system-critical file pathsâ€”often indicative of reconnaissance, privilege escalation, malware staging, or data exfiltration. These patterns may involve access to uncommon directories by non-system accounts or unexpected processes interacting with protected areas.

- name: Abnormal File Path Access Patterns
- description: Detects unexpected or suspicious access to sensitive or hidden file paths (e.g., SYSTEM32, ProgramData, AppData\Roaming) which may indicate privilege escalation, malware staging, or unauthorized reconnaissance.

## Remediation
#### Triage

- Examine accessed file paths via `winlog.event_data.ObjectName`.
- Identify the process and user performing the access (`process.name`, `winlog.event_data.SubjectUserName`).
- Correlate with process command line, parent-child relationships, and recent execution history.

#### Containment

- Suspend or terminate suspicious processes using `taskkill` or EDR console.
- Isolate host if lateral movement or staging is confirmed.
- Remove unauthorized persistence mechanisms or startup entries.

#### Remediation

- Harden access to sensitive directories using ACLs and GPO.
- Enable file integrity monitoring (FIM) to track changes in critical paths.
- Apply application allowlisting to restrict binary execution in non-standard locations.

#### Post-Incident Review

- Determine if accessed files were altered, exfiltrated, or just enumerated.
- Refine path-based rules to reduce false positives without compromising coverage.
- Update baseline behavior models for file access patterns by user roles.
