# Abnormal SSL Certificate Usage

**Detects** suspicious SSL/TLS certificate usage patterns, such as self-signed certificates, expired certificates in use, or certificates issued by unauthorized or untrusted CAs. Adversaries often leverage custom or misconfigured certificates to facilitate man-in-the-middle attacks, C2 channels, or data exfiltration tunnels.

## Remediation
#### Triage

- Identify certificate details (`tls.server_certificate_subject`, `tls.server_certificate_issuer`, `tls.server_certificate_not_valid_after`) and associated endpoints (`host.ip`, `host.name`).  
- Validate the certificate chain against your organizationâ€™s approved CA allowlist and certificate transparency logs.  
- Correlate with application/process logs to determine the context of certificate usage.

#### Containment

- Block or redirect traffic presenting unauthorized or expired certificates at the perimeter proxy or firewall.  
- Remove self-signed or unapproved certificates from host trust stores.  
- Quarantine affected endpoints until a valid certificate is provisioned.

#### Remediation

- Enforce certificate pinning or maintain a strict CA allowlist for all critical services.  
- Implement automated certificate monitoring and renewal workflows (e.g., ACME protocol).  
- Deploy TLS inspection and validation on all ingress/egress traffic.

#### Post-Incident Review

- Audit corporate certificate inventories and update trust stores.  
- Analyze historical TLS flows for covert or anomalous patterns.  
- Update SOC playbooks and detection logic to incorporate lessons learned and refine thresholds.
